This followed a meeting with NCR states earlier in the day with the focus on vehicular pollution, dust pollution from construction activities and roads, and emissions from thermal power plants and industrial pollution. At least 50% of the government staff across NCR will work from home and private establishments will be encouraged to do so till November 21.Among other measures announced by the commission are banning of DG sets in entire NCR, except for emergency services, and ensuring that all industries in NCR with gas connections are run only on gas, failing which they are to be shut down. Delhi’s air quality deteriorated on Tuesday, again entering the “severe” category at 403.Of the 11 thermal power plants, the five that have been allowed to function are NTPC, Jhajjar; Mahatma Gandhi, TPS, CLP Jhajjar; Panipat TPS, HPGCL; Nabha Power Ltd TPS, Rajpura; and Talwandi Sabo TPS, Mansa.\n",
