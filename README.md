Summary Extraction is the technique for generating meaningful and complete information of the text while focusing on the sections that convey useful information, and without losing the overall meaning of the text. Summary Extraction aims to transform lengthy Text into shortened versions, which makes it easy to understand. 

For Summary extraction from the News Articles we are usin a Library called nwewspaper3k . Where we can collect the urls of the article and collect the text 

## Summary Extracting newspaper3k Library.

Using the newspaper Library we can collect the complete text of the Article just by using a predefined function called Article. There are some advantages and disadvantages to using the newspaper3k library.


```bash
from newspaper import Article
url = ‚ÄúEnter the url‚Äù
article = Article(url)
```
The complete text of an article was in a variable called article. 

## Advantages of using newspaper3k
1. Predefined functions
2. Easy to access the complete text of an Article
3. Easy to collect the Author names and Publish dates of an article with authors and publish_date functions.
4. Using the newspaper3k library it is very easy to collect the summary of an article using a variable. summary function. 

## Disadvantages of using newspaper3k

1. Cannot download the complete URLs of the website if we run the code n number of times
2. The summary collected using newspaper3k was not as expected
3. Using a newspaper library becomes difficult during the time of deployment on Heroku. Because Heroku has no corpora keywords as the default installed, we need to provide corpora keywords in a text file while deployment. 

# Implementation 

Punkt can pick its first 5 tokenized sentences and string them together to form a complete summary. Punkt helps us to divide the complete text into a list of sentences.
To overcome the disadvantages of newspapers 3k and to collect meaningful summaries. Now we are using a Library called spacy.

Before using the techniques of the spacy library we just took the help of the nltk library to convert the complete text into sentences. For this purpose, we are using a function called tokenizer.

With the help of spacy the collected text and the individual words where given some importance based on there embedding vectors results and findiing the performance of each word  compare to the entire length. By doing this technique we can collect the probability percentage of text as a summary .

# REGEX

Using regex we just clean the data .using meta characters and spatial sequential for cleaning purpose 

<h3> Meta characters </h3> 

                          1 . [] -> returns a match if contains patterns / character specified in []
                          2 . ^ -> string starts with given patterns 
                          3 . $ -> ends with 
                          4 . . -> any character except new line 
                          5 . * -> Zero or more occurences 
                          6 . + -> one or more occurences 
                          7 . {} -> specified number of occurences 

                          

<h3> special sequences </h3> 

                            1 . \d -> if a given string has digits (0-9)
                            2 . \D -> if the given string does not have strings
                            3 . \w -> if a given string has word characters(a-z,A-Z,0-9)
                            4 . \W -> if a given string does not have word characters
                            5 . \s -> if given string has spaces
                            6 . \S -> if given string has no spaces

                         

<p> Techniques used for cleaning </P> 


                         1 . Removing unwanted Punctuation for the text
                         2 . Removing URLS from the text 
                         3 . Removing hashtags 
                         4 . Removing Extra white spaces 
                         5 . Lowering the text 
                         6 . removing the own mentions
